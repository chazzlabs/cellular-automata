# Cellular Automata

This is some fun with cellular automata inspired by [this video from funfunfunction.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc-fVdbjAwk)

Some of the code is borrowed from the gist linked in the YouTube video description, but the plan is to expand on their start and make something
cool.
